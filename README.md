# emacs-config
My personal emacs configuration

# Installation
- Run `install.sh` or link/copy emacs to $HOME/.emacs and lisp to $HOME/.emacs.d/
- If you did not run the `install.sh`, create the folder `$HOME/.emacs.d/backup`
- run `M-x package-install RET xclip RET` (RET is the enter key) in emacs to install xclip and allow copies between emacs and X11
